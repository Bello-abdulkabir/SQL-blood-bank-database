# SQL-blood-bank-database

Developed using MySQL.

The database stores the basic necessary information of a blood bank ( donor, patient, blood bags, requests, donation frequency).

All codes were written nicely and ran to confirm it free from errors. 

Database triggers were put in place to the best of my knowledge so as to prevent medically unfit donors from having their records stored in the database. 

The column “need_status” in the patients table stores the level of urgency (as either “high” or “low”) a patient needs a blood donation.
